<h1>I Really Hope Eloquence for Android Survives</h1>
<p>Code Factory last month announced Eloquence back on Android, this time as nice, shiny, 64-bit.</p>
<p>I was surprised at the lack of media coverage, honestly. There was some, but not much that I noticed.</p>
<p>I'm optimistic that this will just pass smoothly and everyone will be happpy, unlike when Voice Dream Reader converted to a subscription model.</p>
<p>I completely condone and understand the subscription model. Of course, it's not as great for the customer who has to pay, but it is great in the sense that there is ongoing revenue!</p>
<p>I really hope this round of Eloquence on Android survives. If you feel you can or would use it, I would encourage you to subscribe!</p>
<p>I could not locate the pricing besides in the app, so I'll state it here, as of December 3, 2025. It is $2.99/mo or $29.99/yr. You can use it entirely for free. Except that every time it speaks, it says, "Please Register" before it speaks the passage. I have not tested this, but there may be a character limit per prompt.</p>
<p>I think this is entirely reasonable.</p>
<p>For me, it IS worth that. I think I paid about $60 for the Eloquence app on Windows, and will continue to use it as long as I can.</p>
<p>I think Code Factory has struck a good balance with the subscription model. I don't think it's too expensive, but also provides value to Code Factory. If it was $100/yr, like Microsoft 365 almost is, it wouldn't be worth that price to me. I could just use RHvoice. But since it is the price it is, I hope to subscribe and enjoy it.</p>
<p>I did notice on Android that you can change the sample rate, which is nice.</p>
<p>Please comment your thoughts.</p>
