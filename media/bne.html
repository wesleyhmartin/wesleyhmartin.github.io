<h1>Don't Buy the BrailleNote Touch Plus—But Should You Buy the Evolve?</h1>
<p>HumanWare today announced a new generation of BrailleNote. This comes immediately after my previous blog post encouraging people not to buy the Touch Plus. But will the Evolve save the BrailleNote reputation?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>The thing is, we don’t really have anything yet. We don’t have technical specs, prices—only vague motions in certain directions. Is this still going to have a screen? A braille keyboard?</p>
<p>One thing I am extremely excited and optimistic about is the transition to Windows 11 Pro. I think this will serve HumanWare much better than Android.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it have been something if they launched with Windows 10 Pro, promising an update soon…</p>
<p>I’m very hopeful for this product and really would like to get my little hands on it. Here’s hoping I get to see it someday. But what I want right now is specs. Although they haven’t launched yet, who knows when they will.</p>
<p>I was taking a look on their website to see if they still sold the Touch Plus; thankfully, they don’t—except I did find an intriguing entry I had not seen before: HumanWare BrailleNote Touch Plus – My First Notetaker (Special Edition). It’s a $2,300 notetaker for “ages 4–8.” From what I’m reading, it seems like a cross between a Brailliant BI X and a BrailleNote Touch Plus. Its specs are pretty much identical to the regular Touch Plus, except, from what I can gather, it does not offer third-party apps—but don’t quote me on this. Again, there isn’t much solid info. It almost feels like they took the Touch Plus, halved the price, and said it’s for young learners.</p>
<p>I will probably write another post or update this one once Evolve is launched.</p>
<p>I am incredibly excited for this. As I said, it is the longest gap ever between two BrailleNotes, similar to the gap between the Apex and the Touch.</p>
