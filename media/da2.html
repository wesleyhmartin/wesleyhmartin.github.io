<h1>What I Like and Don't Like About the DA2 Player</h1>
<p>I received my DA2 player a few weeks ago, and I like it overall. Let me address its pros and cons.</p>
<p>The DA2 player is a bit wider than the DS1/DA1, which I will refer to from now on as the "old" players. When you first encounter it, it appears to have many more buttons than the old players, but in fact, it only has a few more. It is a bit lighter tan the old ones.</p>
<h2>What I Like About It</h2>
<h3>Bluetooth</h3>
<p>Finally, it has Bluetooth, with a reliable Bluetooth radio, which allows you to connect to earbuds, headphones, glasses, hearing aids, speakers, and more. Note that you cannot connect Bluetooth keyboards or Braille displays.</p>
<h3>BARD support</h3>
<p>It has BARD support, allowing you to download books and magazines and add them to your wish list.</p> 
<h3>Date and Time</h3>
<p>I've pined for this feature for years! I honestly don't get why you have to set it yourself, as it is connected to the internet, but it's just once, so no big deal.</p>
<h3>USB-C Charging</h3>
<p>No power cord in the back anymore, and you can finally connect it to a computer directly. You cannot use this to connect keyboards or audio devices, as far as I am aware.</p>
<h3>32GB Internal Storage</h3>
<p>A decent amount of internal storage, especially if you're just storing NLS books, which are fairly small.</p>
<h3>No Specific Audio Folder Anymore</h3>
<p>You can put audio files anywhere, not just in the Audio+Podcasts folder. It will treat each folder as a separate book, which could be a pro or a con, but will label every one of those folder books "Other Books."</p>
<h3>Includes Author Names on the Bookshelf</h3>
<p>Maybe it's just me, but it's a feature I didn't know I wanted until I had it. Additionally, you can press Info to hear more... well, info, like book number and description.</p>
<h3>Better Speaker</h3>
<p>Maybe it's me, but I think it's a vastly better speaker than the old players.</p>
<h3>The Jingles</h3>
<p>The player plays jingle sounds when you start it, shut it down, etc. Gotta love 'em.</p>

<h3>Much More Responsive Overall</h3>
<p>When I press a key, it happens. I didn't notice the latency of the old player until I started adjusting the volume on the new player. Wow! Kudos to the engineers on this one.</p>

<h3>Play/Stop Bookshelf</h3>
<p>They added a Bookshelf button, but if you press and hold Play/Stop, it'll still take you to the Bookshelf. Old habits die hard.</p>

<h3>Support for NTFS</h3>
<p>The player supports the NTFS file system, allowing for higher-capacity flash drives.</p>

<h2>Things to Improve</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that this is a free product, so you can't expect everything, and I appreciate what they've done already, and keep in mind some bugs mentioned may be ironed out in future. If I notice that they have, I will update this post.</p>

<h3>Text-to-Speech</h3> 
<p>Pro or con, you decide, but it means a less natural-sounding experience. I will fondly miss "Player on."</p> 

<h3>Wi-Fi</h3>
<p>Wi-Fi is kinda there, but the radio, in my experience, is pretty hit-or-miss. I found it didn't detect the network well, and was extremely slow.</p>

<h3>Speed Adjustment Skipping</h3>
<p>When you adjust the speed, the audio will skip a tad bit, and if you're using TTS to read the user guide, it may jump to the next section.</p>

<h3>Voices</h3>
<p>I have always found the A Capella voices included on Humanware-designed products distasteful, as in my opinion they are neither natural-sounding nor responsive. There are a few English voices and one Spanish voice currently available.</p>

<h3>Braille Markings Are Confusing</h3>
<p>They are sometimes hard to distinguish their meanings on first glance, and the button location can vary. In saying so, I appreciate that once you've learned the buttons, it's not that big of a deal.</p>

<h3>Startup Time</h3>
<p>It takes around five times longer to start than the old player, and it also takes longer to refresh the bookshelf.</p>

<p>Overall, a great improvement, and I congratulate and thank the Library for consistently excellent service.</p>
