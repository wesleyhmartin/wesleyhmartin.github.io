    <h1>What I Like and Don't Like About the DA2 Player</h1>
    <p>I received my DA2 player a few weeks ago, and I like it overall. Let me address its pros and cons.</p>
    <p>The DA2 player is a bit wider than the DS1/DA1, which I will refer to from now on as the "old" players. It appears to have many more buttons at first glance, but actually only has a few more. It's also slightly lighter than the old ones.</p>

    <h2>What I Like About It</h2>

    <h3>Bluetooth</h3>
    <p>Finally, it has Bluetooth! You can connect earbuds, headphones, glasses, hearing aids, speakers, and more. No support for Bluetooth keyboards or Braille displays, though.</p>

    <h3>BARD Support</h3>
    <p>It allows downloading books and magazines from BARD, plus adding them to your wish list. Super handy.</p>

    <h3>Date and Time</h3>
    <p>I've pined for this for years! It's weird you have to set it manually even though it's online, but you only do it once, so no biggie.</p>

    <h3>USB-C Charging</h3>
    <p>No more power cord in the back—hallelujah! And it connects directly to your PC. No keyboard or audio device support here, though.</p>

    <h3>32GB Internal Storage</h3>
    <p>A solid amount for NLS books, which are relatively small in size.</p>

    <h3>No Specific Audio Folder Anymore</h3>
    <p>Place audio files anywhere. Each folder is treated as a separate book labeled “Other Books.” Could be a pro or a con.</p>

    <h3>Includes Author Names on the Bookshelf</h3>
    <p>A feature I didn’t know I wanted until I had it. Press Info for more details like book number and description.</p>

    <h3>Better Speaker</h3>
    <p>Vastly improved audio compared to the old players. Maybe it's just me, but I love it.</p>

    <h3>The Jingles</h3>
    <p>Startup, shutdown, etc. all have cute little jingles. Chef’s kiss.</p>

    <h3>Much More Responsive Overall</h3>
    <p>No more sluggishness. Press a key, get a result. The volume control really showcases this.</p>

    <h3>Play/Stop Bookshelf</h3>
    <p>There's now a dedicated Bookshelf button, but you can still press and hold Play/Stop like the good ol’ days.</p>

    <h3>Support for NTFS</h3>
    <p>Supports the NTFS file system, which means larger-capacity flash drives. Win!</p>

    <h2>Things to Improve</h2>
    <p>This is a free product, so perfection isn’t expected. I appreciate the hard work, and some issues may be fixed in updates.</p>

    <h3>Text-to-Speech</h3>
    <p>This one’s a toss-up. It’s less natural-sounding, and I’ll miss “Player on.” RIP old-school charm.</p>

    <h3>Wi-Fi</h3>
    <p>It’s... there. But it’s slow and doesn’t always find networks well. Needs improvement.</p>

    <h3>Speed Adjustment Skipping</h3>
    <p>Adjusting speed causes the audio to skip. With TTS, it might even jump to the next section. Not ideal.</p>

    <h3>Voices</h3>
    <p>The A Capella voices aren’t my favorite—neither natural-sounding nor responsive. Limited options for now.</p>

    <h3>Braille Markings Are Confusing</h3>
    <p>Some markings are unclear at first, and button positions vary. But once learned, it's manageable.</p>

    <h3>Startup Time</h3>
    <p>It takes way longer to start and refresh the bookshelf compared to the old model. Patience is a virtue.</p>

    <p>Overall, a great improvement. Thanks to the Library for their consistently excellent service!</p>
