    <h1>Introducing DEB, the Emoji Describer</h1>

    <p>It's been about two weeks since I blogged last, but I have a very exciting announcement to share with whoever might be reading this post.</p>

    <p>I'm introducing a simple little utility as my official public "debut app." It's called <strong>DEB</strong>, and it's simply an interactive CLI to look up emojis, and uses Google Gemini to describe them.</p>

    <p>In the future, I'm hoping to make a GUI for the app sometime.</p>

    <h2>How Much?</h2>

    <p>I'm happy to say: nothing. It's completely free.<br />
    Gemini costs are up to you. Gemini offers a free usage limit, which is plenty for everyday use.</p>

    <h2>When?</h2>

    <p>When will it be released, you ask?<br />
    I'm thrilled to say that the app was released alongside this blog post, and is officially available now.</p>

    <h2>Where?</h2>
