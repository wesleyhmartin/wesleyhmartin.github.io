        <h2>Lyrics</h2>

        <h3 id="verse1">1</h3>
        <p>Daddy, will you be there for me when I wake up in the night<br>When I cannot close my eyes and sleep, will you rock me, hold me tight?<br>Will you drive my tractor on the floor, pitch my balls and push my swing?<br>May I come to you with broken toys, will you mend my broken things?<br>Will you be there, will you love my mommy, hug me every day,<br>(O Daddy,) Daddy, will you be home at night, teach me how to pray?</p>

        <a href="#verse4">Jump to Verse 4</a>

        <h3>2</h3>
        <p>When you come from your work at night, daddy, then I want you near,<br>There are problems that are big to me, will stop and give your ear?<br>I don't care if you are rich or poor, I just want to have your heart,<br>I just want to know that you're my friend, I will try to do my part.<br>Will you be there when I have a problem and I need to share,<br>(O Daddy,) Daddy, will you be there for me, will you really care?</p>

        <h3>3</h3>
        <p>Daddy, will you be there for me when I need some one to care,<br>When I face this life's complexities and I'm ready to despair?<br>Am I more to you than anything? Do you love me? I'm your child!<br>May I come to you with broken dreams when I'm broken and defiled?<br>Will you be there, will you guide me, will you help me to forgive,<br>(O Daddy,) Daddy, will you be there for me, teach me how to live?</p>

        <h3 id="verse4">4</h3>
        <p>Daddy will you be there for me when I face my setting sun,<br>When I stand before the judgment seat will I hear those words, "Well done"?<br>Will you have taught me right from wrong, will your teaching stand the test,<br>Will I enter into heaven's land with my Lord forever blest?<br>I'm depending on you, Daddy, and I hope you understand,</p>
