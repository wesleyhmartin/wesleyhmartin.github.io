        <h2>Lyrics</h2>

        <h3 id="verse1">1</h3>
        <p>Each day I'll do a golden deed,<br>
        By helping those who are in need;<br>
        My life on earth is but a span,<br>
        And so I'll do the best I can, (the best I can).</p>

        <h3 id="refrain">Refrain:</h3>
        <p>Life's evening sun is sinking low,<br>
        A few more days and I must go,<br>
        To meet the deeds that I have done,<br>
        Where there will be no setting sun. (no setting sun.)</p>
        <a href="#verse5">Jump to Verse 5</a>

        <h3 id="verse2">2</h3>
        <p>To be a child of God each day,<br>
        My light must shine along the way;<br>
        I'll sing His praise while ages roll<br>
        And strive to help some troubled soul, (some troubled soul). <a href="#refrain">Refrain</a></p>

        <h3 id="verse3">3</h3>
        <p>The only life that will endure,<br>
        Is one that's kind and good and pure;<br>
        And so for God I'll take my stand,<br>
        Each day I'll lend a helping hand, (a helping hand). <a href="#refrain">Refrain</a></p>

        <h3 id="verse4">4</h3>
        <p>I'll help someone in time of need,<br>
        And journey on with rapid speed;<br>
        I'll help the sick and poor and weak,<br>
        And words of kindness to them speak, (kind words I'll speak). <a href="#refrain">Refrain</a></p>

        <h3 id="verse5">5</h3>
        <p>While going down life's weary road,<br>
        I'll try to lift some trav'ler's load;<br>
        I'll try to turn the night to day,<br>
        Make flowers bloom along the way, (the lonely way). <a href="#refrain">Refrain</a></p>
