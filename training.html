<h1>Welcome to Technology Training for the Blind</h1>
<p>If you're just starting out and want to get familiar with Windows with NVDA, Android, or Audacity for Windows, I'm here for you. Or you might be familiar with the tech, but you have a problem you just can't solve.</p>

<h2>What I Train</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Android Smartphones and tablets using the TalkBack screen reader</li>
    <li>Windows 11 using the NVDA Screen Reader</li>
    <li>Audacity 3 with Windows 10 or 11 using the NVDA Screen Reader</li>
</ul>
<p>If you'd like, I can also remotely access your machine, so I can demonstrate as I explain. I train using either the telephone or Google Meet.</p>

<h2>Pricing and Legal</h2>
<p>I charge the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 hour: $15</li>
    <li>2 hours: $30</li>
    <li>3 hours: $40</li>
    <li>4 hours: $55</li>

    <li>10 hours: $120</li>
    <li>15 hours: $175</li>

</ul>
<p>Follow-up Support: After the session, I offer 7 days of follow-up email support. You can get more for $2.99/month or $.89/week. That includes unlimited email and text message support.</p>

<h3>Ready?</h3>
<p>Okay. You can either give me a call to discuss time and date, or you can do it yourself online. My phone number is (1) 570-500-0665.</p>

<h4>Do It Online</h4>
<p>Before you do it online, you'll have to agree to these Terms:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> If you provide any personal information, such as your name, phone number, or email address, I will not share it with third parties without your explicit consent. If you grant me remote access to your computer, I will only interact with files, programs, or environments necessary for the session. Please ensure any unrelated apps, files, or environments are closed prior to granting access.</li>
    <li><strong>Payments:</strong> I do not have access to your payment details and will not charge you fraudulently. If you cancel a session, I will issue a refund within seven days. If you feel the training session did not meet your expectations, I will offer a 100% refund. Payments are processed through PayPal. Please review PayPal's terms and conditions before completing your purchase.</li>
    <li><strong>Recording:</strong> If you choose to have the session recorded, you may opt out of the recording at any time. You can decide between the following options:
        <ul>
            <li>(1) The recording will be sent to you and then deleted within 24 hours.</li>
            <li>(2) The recording will be sent to you and stored securely for future access if needed.</li>
        </ul>
        I will not record the session without your explicit consent.
    </li>
</ol>
